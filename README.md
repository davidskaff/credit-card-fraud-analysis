# Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions Analysis ðŸ’³

By: Jasleen Brar, Sneha Kumari, Jasleen Jasleen and David Skaff.

## Project Overview ðŸ“‹

This project focuses on the analysis of credit card fraudulent transactions. The main goal is to answer the following questions:

1. How does the frequency of fraud and cybercrime categories vary?
2. What are the most common solicitation methods in fraud cases?
3. What is the distribution of dollar loss due to fraud?
4. How does the frequency of fraud transactions vary in different provinces/states?

## Dataset ðŸ“Š

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Open Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/6a09c998-cddb-4a22-beff-4dca67ab892f/resource/43c67af5-e598-4a9b-a484-fe1cb5d775b5/view/34ecea5c-4912-49d6-bea3-7b9aead8f4bc). The data was cleaned to show the Province/State, Fraud and Cybercrime Thematic Categories, Solicitation Method, Gender, Victim Age Range, and Dollar Loss in terms of fraudulent transactions.

## Data Storage ðŸ“‚

The cleaned dataset is stored in an SQL database for easy access and manipulation.

## Data Analysis ðŸ’¡

Further analysis was performed using Python to calculate percentages and correlations. This helped to gain deeper insights into the data and answer our main questions.

## Visualization ðŸš€

An HTML file connected to a Javascript file was created to display **five graphs:**

1. A bar chart that visualizes the frequency of different categories of fraud and cybercrime.
2. A pie chart that represents the frequency of different solicitation methods.
3. A histogram that represents the frequency of different ranges of dollar loss.
4. A Stacked Bar Chart that represents the frequency of different age ranges of victims for each gender.
5. A choropleth map that represents the frequency of incidents in different provinces/states with the help of the [geojson file](https://cartographyvectors.com/map/116-canada-outline-with-provinces).

## Web Application ðŸ’»

A Flask application (`app.py`) was created to connect and host the database. This allows the visualizations to be displayed on a web page, making the analysis results more accessible and understandable.

## Presentation ðŸŽ‰

All the findings and visualizations were compiled into a presentation to effectively communicate the results of the analysis.

We hope this project provides valuable insights into credit card fraudulent transactions and helps in the development of effective strategies to combat fraud.
